## What is this

This software is a customized and simplified Wine front-end program. By automatically configuring the Wine running environment and recording the location of the executable files that need to be run, you can use (and update) your Windows applications with just the click of a button without any complex command line operations.

## Features

- Manage Wine environment
- Manage the download, update and uninstall of applications
- Provide relative news

## Installation

- Download from release page
- Drag and drop the application into `/Applications` folder
- Find app in `LaunchPad` and open
- Enjoy

## Update your Asagl

You can update the application in the same way as the above installation method, but we recommend that you update the application through the in-app method, which is more convenient and faster:

- Click the `Asagl` tab on the system menu bar on the top section of your minitor
- Click the `Check for Update` button and wait for a few seconds.
